# Brute Force Detector

This project detects repeated failed login attempts that may indicate a
brute-force attack.

## What it does
- Reads authentication or login log files
- Counts failed login attempts
- Identifies suspicious patterns based on frequency

## Why it matters
Brute-force attacks are a common threat in cloud and Linux environments.
Detecting repeated failed logins is a foundational security skill.

## What I’m learning
- Log analysis
- Pattern detection
- Security monitoring concepts
- Python scripting for security
